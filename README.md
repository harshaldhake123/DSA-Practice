# DSA-Practice

This repository mainly auto-syncs my LeetCode submissions using the [LeetCode Tracker](https://github.com/JeffreyGbeho/leetcode-tracker)
- Track my progress on LeetCode problems.
- Maintain a searchable archive of solved problems.
- Share solutions and approaches for reference.

This repo is for personal learning and tracking.  
Solutions are correct and practical, but may not always include the most optimal or all possible approaches.
